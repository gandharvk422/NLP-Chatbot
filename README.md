# NLP‑Chatbot

A simple conversational chatbot built using natural language processing techniques in Python.

##  Features

- Train your own chatbot model using provided training scripts.
- Process and classify user input to generate meaningful responses.
- Includes serialized model and support files for quick setup:
  - `chatbotmodel.h5`
  - `classes.pkl`
  - `words.pkl`
- Easily extend with your own intents and training data (`intense.json`).

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Training the Model

1. Customize `intense.json` with your own intents, patterns, and responses.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```
3. This will generate:
   - `chatbotmodel.h5`
   - `classes.pkl`
   - `words.pkl`

### Using the Chatbot

- Launch the chatbot interface:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
- Chat interactively through the console — type your message and receive responses based on your training data.

##  Customization & Extension

- Expand the conversation scope by adding more intents in `intense.json`.
- Enhance preprocessing, response logic, or model architecture in `main.py` and `training.py`.
- Integrate more advanced NLP features like context handling or sentiment analysis.

##  Example

See `codesnap.png` for a screenshot of the chatbot responding to input.
